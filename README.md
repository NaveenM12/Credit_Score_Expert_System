# Credit_Score_Expert_System

## Running the project
This project uses an expert system coded in LISP to assign credit core from 10 to 100, 
returning possible loans and interest rates. Run the project by executing the finalProj.clp file

## Background
For the knowledge base of the system, I interviewing data analytics executives at FICO and Personetics to
understand the key aspects of what goes into assigning credit risk and then encoded the rules into the system. 
The model is also able to generate rules by itself and self-write code based on pattern matching, making the
system adaptive!

## Motivation
The main motivation for the process was to tackle discrimination in current credit score systems. Current credit score systems
have a lot of bias in predicting credit risk, particularly as it relates to factors such as race. While using these factors may
result in a more accurate model, they lead to unfair discrimination. This project essentially served as a proof of concept that accurate
credit ratings could be achieved without using unfair, discriminatory demographic data.
